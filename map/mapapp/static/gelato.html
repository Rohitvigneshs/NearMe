    <p>Gelato is a popular frozen dessert that originated in Italy. It is known for its rich and creamy texture, intense flavors, and lower fat content compared to traditional ice cream. Gelato is made with a base of milk, sugar, and various flavorings, such as fruits, nuts, chocolate, and more. It is churned at a slower speed than ice cream, which incorporates less air and results in a denser product. Gelato is typically served at a slightly warmer temperature than ice cream, allowing the flavors to be more pronounced. It is enjoyed worldwide and comes in a wide variety of flavors to suit different tastes.</p>
